# Google Search Results Page

Deconstruction and non-functional rebuilding of [Google Search Results Page](https://www.google.com/search?q=google) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), HTML and plain CSS is used in this project.

I approached a more aesthetic solution with the redesign, adding a dark mode and making use of shadows and subtle animations, keeping the essence of Material Design.
